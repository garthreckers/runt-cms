		<p>My love for photography started in high school in a photography class. Since freshman year, I had put photography as my lower priority for electives, but after a trip to Seattle and using my families cheap camera, I started getting interested. The next year I put it as my top priority and it ended up becoming my top priority for every semester after that. The class was a black and white film class that really helped me learn the basics and learn to take photos without the distraction of color. I still love black and white film to this day, but with my medium format camera breaking and no access to a darkroom, digital is all I can manage now.</p>

		<p>Photography really jumped from a minor hobby to a true passion in 2008 when I was offered the chance to go to Norway with the Adventure Travel Trade Association to take photographs and video for their World Summit. When I realized how beautiful places outside of the US (even off the west coast since I havenâ€™t ventured far from here) can be, I caught the travel bug and wanted to go everywhere. Money has killed this travel bug, but the dream is still there, especially with a wife who wants to travel just as bad as me.</p>

		<p>So there is my brief history of my photography. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook to get the latest news on my photography. I hope to add to these photos just as soon as I can take a break from working to travel. Gotta pay for the travel somehow.</p>
